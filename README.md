# phd-defence
The presentation for my Ph.D. defence, Frankfurt, 25/11/16.

 * A pdf version of the talk can be found [here](https://github.com/Irubataru/phd-defence/releases/download/presented/presentation.pdf)
 * The corresponding thesis is also [available](https://github.com/Irubataru/phd-thesis)

## Compilation instructions

To compile the user requires xelatex and a fairly new version of pgf and pgfplots. The package also explicitly includes the 
Firefox [Fira font](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira), which must be available to xelatex on compilation.
This can however be disabled by editing the [definitions/plot_fonts.tex](definitions/plot_fonts.tex) (e.g. simply commenting out its contents).

The presentation used the [metropolis theme](https://github.com/matze/mtheme), which should be included in newer versions of TeX Live.

When all of these criterias are met, simply run `make` in the repository, and a pdf will be produced. The only thing missing from the
full presentation is the paper by LÃ¼scher and Weisz referred to on slide 12. This has to be supplied by you if you have a pdf copy.
